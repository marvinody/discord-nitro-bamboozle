    <h2>Why make this?</h2>
    <p>Discord is planning on releasing a new feature to allow users to mask links in markdown that everyone by default can do. I made this site to show why it's a bad idea to not have that power behind a permission that moderators can disable to the wider public.</p>

    <h2>Is it that bad of a feature?</h2>
    <p>I think it's a great feature for moderators to make nicer announcements and think it should stay. It should just be more restrictive in the users who can use them in public servers</p>

    <h2>How do I prevent this being abused in my server?</h2>
    <p>Well, we can use some AutoMod regex to prevent links from being masked and still allow regular links. I won't be sharing any regex because it's a pain to get it right.</p>
